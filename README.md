An Attempt to show 3D mesh images using Phonegap Build



Feb 8, 2014 

Got .stl and .obj 3d formats working in a standalone Android App, meaning the 3D graphics work even when data connectivity is not working. I spent a while trying to get .3ds format working, but could not using my Samsung S3 Mobile phone. I have left both the .3ds file and the relevant .js file in the repository for others to try.


This App is amazing at displaying 3D graphics. It is small, lightweight and fast. The touch comands are a bit sensitive. 
Note: 3D printing files do not contain the colour when exported from blender. Wavefront .obj files do save the colour probably in a .mtl file format. Also the .min.js files did not work for me.

Feb11, 2014 Just tested online files and they work fine. Must use the complete URL.



Google jsc3d   version is at
https://code.google.com/p/jsc3d/

This was made by a fellow called Humu and is a very impressive set of javascript files.




Note: I originally tried to get 3D files working from github, since they can be viewed online now. However on my platform they did not show well and showed in a full github window which is not ideal. Do not use the suggested script from github but instead use something like this javascript command.
